# PostOffice

Test and validation of a PostOffice, project developed for Software Testing and Validation subject

---

## Project description

The development of large information systems is a complex process and demands several layers of abstraction.
One first step is the specification of the problem in a rigorous way. After a rigorous specification of the problem,
one may perform formal analysis and prove the correctness of the implementation. If the implementation is not
correct, one may discover 
aws that would not be easy to detect in any other way. Complementarily, and in
particular when a solution has already been implemented, the quality of the solution may be assessed by running
tests in order to detect existing 
aws.
The project of this course consists of the design of a set of test suites given a specification. This specification
models an application that manages a post office. The main goal of this project is for the students to learn the
concepts related to software testing and acquire some experience in designing test cases.
